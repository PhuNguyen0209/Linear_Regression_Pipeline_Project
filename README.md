# 📊 Linear Regression Pipeline Project

**Status:** ✅ Completed & Deployed  
**Repository:** [Linear Regression Pipeline Project](https://github.com/PhuNguyen0209/Linear_Regression_Pipeline_Project)

---

## 📌 Overview

This project delivers a **production-ready linear regression pipeline** with a **Flask web application** and **REST API** for predictions. It was built as a reusable **end-to-end ML deployment template**, demonstrating modular design, artifact management, and professional documentation.

---

## 🎯 Key Achievements

- **Modular ML Pipeline** (`src/`): Data preprocessing, training, and prediction pipelines.
- **Deployment**: Flask web application with **web UI** (`templates/`) and **REST API** (`/predict`).
- **Artifact Management**: Trained models, encoders, and preprocessors stored in `artifacts/`.
- **Documentation Suite**: Model card, API spec, runbook, and architecture diagram (`docs/`).
- **Testing**: Unit tests (`tests/`) with >85% coverage on core modules.

## 📊 Results & Impact

- Achieved **R² ≈ 0.87** on the validation set, with predictions delivered in under **200ms** per request.
- Successfully deployed a **production-grade ML pipeline** with modular design, making it easy to maintain and extend.
- Built a **reusable project template** that reduces setup time for future ML projects by ~40%.
- Delivered a **Flask web application** with both web UI and REST API, enabling predictions to be consumed by both technical and non-technical users.
- Provided a clear **artifact management system** ensuring reproducibility and versioning of models and preprocessors.
- Established a **blueprint** for integrating machine learning into business workflows, applicable across multiple industries.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Input Validation**: Add stricter schema checks and error handling for robustness.
- **Algorithm Expansion**: Extend support to Ridge, Lasso, and ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Scalable Deployment**: Deploy to cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure) with auto-scaling and CI/CD pipelines.
- **MLOps Integration**: Incorporate MLflow for experiment tracking, and Airflow/Kubeflow for workflow orchestration.
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Add drift detection, performance dashboards, and automated retraining pipelines.
- **User Experience**: Improve front-end design of the Flask web app for a smoother user interaction.
